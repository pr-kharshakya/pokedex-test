   Explanation for issues of type "VisibleForTests":
   This check looks for accesses from production code (e.g. not tests) where
   the access would not have been allowed with the intended production
   visibility.

   Depending on your development environment, you may be able to use an
   @VisibleForTesting annotation to specify the intended visibility if the
   method had not been more widely visible for the tests.

   When using androidx.annotations.VisibleForTesting, the production
   visibility is assumed to be private unless specified with the otherwise=
   parameter. com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting and
   com.android.internal.annotations.VisibleForTesting work similarly with
   their own parameters called productionVisibility and visibility.

   If instead you use org.jetbrains.annotations.VisibleForTesting, there is no
   such parameter, and the production visibility is instead assumed to be "one
   step down" from the testing visibility. For example, if the testing
   visibility is public, the production visibility is assumed to be
   package-private.
